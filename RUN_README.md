# Nex App

See [godoc](https://godoc.elenet.me/github.com/eleme/nex) first for documentations.

It includes:

* What nex provides.
* How to develop under nex framework.
* How to deploy a nex app, and how it's deployed.
* How to upgrade nex framework.

## Important notes to nex users:

* Always pass 'ctx context.Context' to every function call.
* There're lots of generated codes, leave'em be. (filename starts with 'auto-' or there's comment stating not to modify)
* Golang requires lots of typing, it's normal(compared to python).
